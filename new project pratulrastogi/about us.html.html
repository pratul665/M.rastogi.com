  <p> There are many different styles of shoes. Some shoes are just fashion accessory and others help us at different tasks like running, dancing and many other sports. Almost every single sport has a special kind of shoe. For example, cleats are used for soccer while skates are for used in skating. Dancing has several different types of footwear. One of them is the Pointe shoe which was made so a dancer can stand on the tips of his or her toes. There are also many varieties of fashion shoes. The most common ones are heels which are worn for special occasions. Another type is known as a flat. They can be designed the same way as heels but they do not have heels on the bottom. Each type of shoe is made for a special purpose. Some are made just as a fashion item and others are made to help humans at different tasks.
